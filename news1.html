              The famous Notre Dame Cathedral of
              France recently caught on fire
              with many witnesses on scene.
              Reports say a man was on top of
              the building after hours and lit a spark.
              This spark then caused a fire and ended
              up getting the entire top center of the
              Cathedral on fire. Firetrucks quickly reported
              on scene to put out the fire. Although
              it took some time to put out the massive fire,
              firemen were able to put it out. People belive
              the game Assassins Creed France could be used
              as a guide to rebuild the Cathedral.
